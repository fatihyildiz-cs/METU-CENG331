# METU-CENG331

These are all of the material used for CENG331 Computer Architecture class at 2020/2021 Fall at METU.

Bomb Lab: Inspect the assembly code of a unique program to find the input string that would defuse the bomb.

Attack Lab: Perform buffer overflow and Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks on a unique program. 

Architecture Lab: Write Y86-64 (simplified X86-64) programs, extending the sequential Y86-64 simulator by adding a new instruction, and optimizing a Y86-64 program by making design choices on processor level.

Performance Lab: Optimizing memory intensive code by taking advantage of the cache, compiler defaults, and overhead reduction.
